        <h2>How I became alienated</h2>
        <p>I was born on the Planet Pluto when it was still a planet. I completed highschool in a black hole in the middle of the universe. we called our highscool<b><i>"hello, hello, hello, hello!"</b></i> (You say it like an echo) I began college at the University of Saturn. My classes were mostly outside on the ring. When I was 21, I moved to Venus. After getting certified in the Art of being a Venicians, I was hired at the Mars dance club. While on Mars, I went back to school and got a astroidal engineering degree. Now almost 20 years later, I am switching careers again and am becoming a bad ass developer right here on Earth (since pluto is no longer a planet)! Nanu Nanu!</p>
